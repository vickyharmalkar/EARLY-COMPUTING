# EARLY-COMPUTING

Hello world, I'm Vicky Harmalkar and welcome to 9HighTech. Today we are go learn about the origin of computing and also about the early computing devices. In today's world computers has become the Lifeblood and we are living in the time to be remembered as The Electronic Age.



 ABACUS




        For a computing, the earliest recognised device was Abacus invented in Mesopotamia around 2500 BCD. It helps to add and subtract many numbers. It is essentially a hand operating calculator. Much like your hard drive does today it also stores the correct state Of Computation.

 Abacus was created because the scale of society has become larger for a single person could keep and manipulate in their mind. In  each band on the bottom row represent a single unit, in the next row represent 10 unit, then next row 100 unit, and so on....

So if we have to add 1551 we just have to add 1 to the bottom row, then 5 to 2nd row, 5 to 3rd row and 1 to the 4th row and Abacus, can also store the total.



 ASTROLABE






Over the next 4000 years all sorts of clever computing devices where developed by humans, like the Astrolabe which enable ships to calculate their latitude at sea. To calculate sunrise, tides, positions of celestial bodies and even just the time and there are literally hundreds of types of clock's created.
